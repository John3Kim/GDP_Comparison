# GDP_Comparison
This dashboard allows users to compare the GDP of one country to the rest of the world.
This was inspired by a reddit post, https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/a7mpdh/south_koreas_gdp_per_capita_vs_the_rest_of_the/, 
on r/DataIsBeautiful. 

Data was preprocessed using R and Python and then were matched with the GDP data provided by the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) to provide a friendly way to interact with the data.
